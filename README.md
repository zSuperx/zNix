# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dot and nix files that build into my system with my preferences. Instructions on how to reproduce my configuration are below.

## Directory Structure

The `system` directory contain `.nix` files for building my system. Note that `hardware-configuration.nix` is automatically generated by your system if using NixOS. To generate it manually, [check out the command](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixos-generate-config) `nixos-generate-config`.

Most other directories at the root level are the config folders for applications I use (like Neovim, Yazi, etc). These are symlinked to their correct locations (typically in `~/.config/...`) by Home Manager. See [`system/home.nix`](https://github.com/piyushkumbhare/dotfiles/blob/master/system/home.nix#L21) to see how it's implemented for this repository.

## Building

Both the system and home-manager configurations are built and managed through Nix Flakes.

To build, first clone the repo:
```console
git clone git@github.com:piyushkumbhare/dotfiles.git
```

Then, granted you have [flake support enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes) in NixOS, you can just run the standard rebuild command but with the flake argument:
```console
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ./dotfiles/system
```

I am not a creative person lol. Here are the links I took some configs or inspiration from:
